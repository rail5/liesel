.SH SYNOPSIS
liesel -i some-book.pdf -o ready-to-print.pdf
.SH DESCRIPTION
Liesel prepares an inputted PDF to be DIY printed at home in pamphlet- or booklet-style
.SH OPTIONS
  -i
    PDF to convert

  -o
    New file for converted PDF
  
  -e
    Export example/preview JPEG image of selected pages
    e.g: -i infile.pdf -e 5,6 -o preview.jpeg

  -g
    Convert PDF to greyscale/black and white

  -r
    Print only specified range of pages (in the order supplied)
    e.g: -r 1-12
    e.g: -r 15-20,25-30
    e.g: -r 10,9,5,2,1
    e.g: -r 20-10 (prints backwards)

    The -r option will process only the selection you give, and in the order that you give it
    "-r 1,2,3,4,5" is the same as "-r 1-5"
    "-r 5-1" will print those pages in descending order

    You can also combine ranges using commas:
    -r 1-5,20-25,7,5-1
    will print first 1,2,3,4,5
    then 20,21,22,23,24,25
    then 7
    then 5,4,3,2,1

  -s
    Print output PDFs in segments of a given size
    e.g: -s 40
      (produces multiple PDFs of 40 pages each)

  -m
    Specify minimum segment size (default is 4)
    e.g: -m 8

    The minimum segment size is only used when printing in segments
    If, for example, you're printing 100 pages with -s 40
    then 2 segments of 40 + 1 "runoff" segment of 20 will be produced
    If, instead, you print those 100 pages with -s 40 -m 21
    then those 20 pages, since they don't meet the minimum segment size,
    will be tacked on to the previous segment,
    making 1 segment of 40 pages + 1 segment of 60

    If -m is not specified, it defaults to 4 pages

  -f
    Force overwrites
      (do not warn about files already existing)

  -v
    Verbose mode

  -b
    Show progress (percentage done)

  -d
    Specify pixels-per-inch density/quality (default is 100)
    e.g: -d 200
      (warning: using extremely large values can crash)

  -t
    Transform output PDF to print on a specific size paper
      e.g: -t us-letter
      or: -t 8.5x11
      or: -t 23x7
      etc

  -l
    Duplex printer "landscape" flipping compatibility
      (flips every other page)
  
  -k
    Convert to pure black-and-white (not grayscale) with given threshold value between 0-100
    e.g: -k 70
      will convert any color with brightness under 70% to pure black, and any brighter color to pure white
      this option is particularly useful in printing PDFs of scanned books with yellowed pages etc
  
  -C
    Crop pages according to specified values
    e.g: -C 10,20,30,40
      order: left,right,top,bottom
      cuts 10 from the left side, 20 from the right side, etc
      numbers are treated as percentages (10% of the left side, etc)
  
  -w
    Widen center margins according to specified value
    e.g: -w 30
      (adds blank space between left and right-hand pages)
  
  -D
    Divide each page into two
      divides the left half and the right half of each page in the input PDF into two separate pages
      this option can be useful in printing PDFs of scanned books which haven't already separated their pages

  -p
    Count pages of input PDF and exit

  -c
    Check validity of command, and do not execute

  -h
    Print this help message

  -q
    Print program info

  -V
    Print version number

Example:
  liesel -i some-book.pdf -g -r 64-77 -f -d 150 -v -b -o ready-to-print.pdf
  liesel -i some-book.pdf -r 100-300,350-400,1-10 -s 40 -t 8.25x11.75 -m 16 -o ready-to-print.pdf
  liesel -i some-book.pdf -r 1,5,7,3,1,50 -l -o ready-to-print.pdf
  liesel -p some-book.pdf
  liesel -c -i some-book.pdf -o output.pdf
