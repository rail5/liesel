liesel (5.0.2) focal; urgency=low

  * Changed minimum -d value to 75
  Values lower than 75 are prone to errors
  But, since 75 is possible, then if the
  user wants it, why not allow it

liesel (5.0.1) focal; urgency=low

liesel (5.0) focal; urgency=low

  * Added -d pixel density option
  Allows the user to adjust quality
  in terms of pixels per inch
  with a 100 ppi minimum

liesel (4.9.1) focal; urgency=low

  * Minor update, updated -h help string

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Wed, 1 Sep 2021 20:15:15 -0400

liesel (4.9) focal; urgency=low

  * Added -v Verbose option
  Added -b BookThief machine-readable option
  Like Verbose -v, can also be used in conjunction
  with -v, but rather than English, it prints
  a percentage done, which BT then uses to update
  a progress bar.
  Cleaned up the code in general (inconsistencies,
  etc oversights which didn't produce errors, but
  nevertheless could stand to be cleaned up)

liesel (4.0) focal; urgency=low

  * Added features: -q and -f
  -q displays program and copyright info
  -f forces overwrites, does not warn user
  about existing files.
  Bug patched: added infile sanity check
  to -p command.
  Bug patched: Swapped order of outfile
  sanity checks.
  Bug patched: outfile sanity checks now
  include -part1.pdf, -part2.pdf, etc
  if printing in segments.
  Improvement: Liesel now appends
  blank pages to the end of the output booklet
  in the case that the total number of pages
  is not divisible by 4, where before, any
  printer would place those blanks in the
  middle of the printed booklet.
  Improvement: Liesel is now more efficient
  in appending blanks when necessary

liesel (3.0) focal; urgency=low

  * Added features: -s and -c
  -s prints the PDF in segments of given size
  as in, -s 40, for 40-page segments
  this produces multiple PDFs
  -c checks the validity of a given command
  but does not execute it.
  Patched a minor bug in -r range values.
  Moved infile/outfile sanity checks to be
  within init switch statement.
  Moved all functions to separate inc files
